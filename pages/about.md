## Abbreviations  
CCLN = *The Collected Correspondence and London Notebooks of Joseph Haydn*, ed. and trans. H. C. Robbins Landon (London: Barrie & Rockliff, 1959).  
GBA = *Joseph Haydn: Gesammelte Briefe und Aufzeichnungen*, ed. Dénes Bartha (Kassel: Bärenreiter, 1965).  
HCW = H. C. Robbins Landon, *Haydn: Chronicle and Works*, 5 vols. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1976-1980).  

## Process  
The intial goal is to have all of the letter and documents that are included in the GBA and CCLN on this site. Occassionally, Bartha includes a document in the GBA that is not included in Landon's CCLN. When this happens, I check the appropriate volume of Landon's HCW to see if it is included there. If so, I use that as my translated text. The HCW (rarely, but sometimes) includes documents that are in neither the GBA or CCLN. To save time, I record these and attempt to find the German original in a different source. The aim is to systematically go through the following sources to find additional relevant letters and documents after the intial run through the GBA and CCLN is complete:
* HCW  
* Mozart's correspondence (likely: Deutsch and Anderson, with the Edge/Black website as a supplement)  
* Beethoven's correspondence
